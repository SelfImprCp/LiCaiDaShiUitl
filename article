 When I write down what I'm grateful for, it's always for things money can't buy.
 You know, thank you for my drive.
 Thank you for my mental strength.
 Thank you for giving me the courage not to give up,
 all those times when it seemed impossible when I know 99% of people would have given up.
 THANK YOU for giving me that strength.
 Thank you for the character to keep going for months,
 for years and years without any progress until I turned it around.
 Thank you for my health!
 Thank you for my family!
 You see, these are my real blessings.


 Every single person on the planet has a story.
 Don't judge people before you truly know them.
 The truth might surprise you.
 Everyone has a story in life.
